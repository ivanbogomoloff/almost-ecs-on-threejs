## Description 

This is implimentation based on articles from `t-machine.org` and some reports from youtube.

This is my vision and glad for critics and recomendations.

TODO...

### Improvements

- Remove component objects/function and make it simple string ?
- Resolve components to json string data like `{id: "position", data: {} }` ?
- Resolve system dependencies to independent initialization ordering or auto configuration order ?
